# 🚀 Day 1 – RTL Design, Simulation, Testbench & Synthesis

This repository documents my learnings and tasks from Day 1 of the India RISC-V Tapeout Program.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Understand the basics of RTL design and its role in the front-end flow.
- Learn how to write and run testbenches to verify functionality.
- Perform simulation using Icarus Verilog and visualize results in GTKWave.
- Carry out synthesis using Yosys and analyze the netlist.

## 📝 Tasks Done
1. Wrote a simple Verilog RTL design (good_mux).  
2. Created a corresponding testbench to apply inputs and check outputs.  
3. Simulated the design using iverilog and viewed waveforms in gtkwave.  
4. Ran synthesis in Yosys to generate the netlist.  
5. Compared RTL simulation results with synthesized netlist simulation.
