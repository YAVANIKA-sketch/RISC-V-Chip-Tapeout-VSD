Day 5 ‚Äì Optimization in Synthesis

üìò Introduction to Optimizations

Learned how IF-CASE constructs, loops, and generate statements affect RTL synthesis.

Understood how synthesis tools optimize logic for area, timing, and resource utilization.

‚ö° IF-CASE Constructs Optimizations

Simplified conditional logic using IF and CASE statements.

Explored incomplete IF/CASE scenarios to see how synthesis handles unassigned branches.

Observed automatic insertion of default logic for overlapping or missing conditions.

‚è±Ô∏è Sequential Logic Optimizations

Studied how loops (for) and generate statements can reduce repetitive code.

Learned how synthesis unrolls loops efficiently to optimize combinational and sequential paths.

Explored lab examples of incomplete loops and overlapping CASE statements to understand tool warnings and optimizations.

üßπ Code Efficiency and Resource Reduction

Removed redundant logic using conditional simplifications.

Observed synthesis handling of dead code and constant propagation in sequential circuits.

Learned techniques to write compact, maintainable RTL that meets area and timing constraints.
