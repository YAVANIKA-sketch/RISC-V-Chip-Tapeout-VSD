Day 4 â€“ GLS, Blocking vs Non-blocking, and Synthesis-Simulation Mismatch

ðŸ“˜ Introduction

Understood the concept of Gate Level Simulation (GLS) and how it differs from RTL simulation.

Learned about synthesis-simulation mismatch and its impact on design verification.

Explored differences between blocking (=) and non-blocking (<=) assignments in Verilog.

âš¡ Key Learnings

GLS Concepts and Flow â€“ Performed GLS using Icarus Verilog and compared with RTL sim.

Synthesis-Simulation Mismatch â€“ Observed mismatches due to uninitialized signals and delays.

Blocking vs Non-blocking â€“ Learned when to use each and pitfalls of mixing them.

Caveats with Blocking Statements â€“ Understood race conditions and incorrect ordering issues.

ðŸ§ª Lab Experiments

GLS and Synth-Sim Mismatch (Part 1 & 2) â€“ Ran testbenches on RTL and synthesized netlist to observe mismatches.

Blocking Statement Mismatch (Part 1 & 2) â€“ Demonstrated how blocking assignments can cause incorrect simulation results compared to synthesis.

âœ¨ Experiment Log (one-liner)
During this lab, we performed Gate Level Simulation (GLS) and studied synthesis-simulation mismatches, focusing on blocking vs non-blocking assignments.
