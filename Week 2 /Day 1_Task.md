# Part 1 - Theory (Conceptual Understanding)

# Summary of SoC Design Fundamentals

1. What is a System-on-Chip (SoC)?

A System-on-Chip (SoC) is an integrated circuit (IC) that combines most or all components of a computer or electronic system onto a single chip. Instead of having separate chips for the processor, memory, and peripherals, an SoC integrates everything, reducing board space, power consumption, and cost.

Key characteristics of an SoC:

Highly compact and efficient, enabling mobile devices, IoT devices, and embedded systems.

Integrates multiple functional units: CPU, memory, peripherals, interconnects, and sometimes specialized accelerators (e.g., GPU, DSP).

Can handle complex computations and tasks in real-time while consuming minimal power.

SoCs are used in smartphones, tablets, wearables, and automotive electronics, providing a complete computing solution on a single chip.

2. Components of a Typical SoC

| Component                         | Function                                                                                                   |
| --------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **CPU (Central Processing Unit)** | Executes instructions, controls the flow of data, and performs computations.                               |
| **Memory**                        | Stores instructions and data. Includes **RAM** (temporary storage) and **ROM/Flash** (permanent storage).  |
| **Peripherals**                   | Interfaces with the external world. Examples include UART, timers, GPIOs, ADC/DAC, and network interfaces. |
| **Interconnect**                  | Bus or Network-on-Chip (NoC) that enables communication between CPU, memory, and peripherals.              |

Additional components may include:

Clock & Reset circuits: Synchronize and initialize the SoC.

Power management modules: Control energy usage efficiently.

Hardware accelerators: Specialized blocks for tasks like encryption, video processing, or AI computation.

3. Why BabySoC is a Simplified Model for Learning SoC Concepts

BabySoC is a pedagogical or educational SoC model that simplifies the complexity of a full SoC for learning purposes:

Reduced complexity: Focuses on core components (CPU, memory, interconnect) without advanced peripherals.

Understandable dataflow: Learners can trace how instructions and data move between modules.

Hands-on experimentation: Easy to simulate using tools like Icarus Verilog and GTKWave.

Step towards real SoC design: Teaches the concepts of clocking, reset, and module communication before diving into full-scale RTL and physical design.

Essentially, BabySoC is a miniature laboratory for understanding SoC behavior in a controlled, manageable environment.

4. The Role of Functional Modelling before RTL and Physical Design

Functional modelling is the process of simulating and validating the behavior of a system at a high level (functional level) before worrying about hardware synthesis.

Why it’s important:

Validates design logic: Ensures the system works correctly from a functional perspective.

Reduces errors early: Helps catch mistakes before writing RTL or performing synthesis.

Speeds up development: Functional models are quicker to simulate than detailed RTL.

Serves as a reference for RTL: Provides a clear specification that RTL and physical design should follow.

Example workflow:

Build a functional model of the CPU, memory, and interconnect.

Simulate data transfer and instruction execution using a tool like Icarus Verilog.

Verify correctness using GTKWave waveforms.

Once validated, proceed to RTL design (register-transfer level) and finally physical design (synthesizable hardware).

Functional modelling bridges the gap between theory and real hardware, ensuring design correctness early in the design cycle.
