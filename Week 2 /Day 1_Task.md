### **Architecture of SoC**

The general architecture of a System on Chip is composed of several functional blocks, including a **processor core, digital signal processor (DSP), memory units, multimedia codecs, network interfaces, and peripheral controllers**.

**Processor:**
This is the central unit of the SoC and may include one or multiple processing cores. Depending on the application, it can be a **microcontroller, microprocessor, or DSP core**. In most modern SoCs, a DSP is commonly integrated to handle computational and control tasks.

### **BabySoC** (short for *Baby System-on-Chip*) 
 It is a **simplified educational model of a System-on-Chip (SoC)** that is used for **learning, simulation, and understanding SoC fundamentals** without the complexity of real industrial SoC designs.

It’s commonly used in **academic projects and training environments** (like SKY130 RTL Design Workshops, Icarus Verilog, or SoC design labs) to teach how a typical SoC works — including its structure, components, and interactions — in a small and easy-to-understand format.

---

Let’s go through each of these terms — **RVMYTH**, **PLL**, and **DAC** — in detail and in a simple, concept-focused way 👇

---

## 🧠 **1. What is RVMYTH?**

**RVMYTH** is a **simple open-source RISC-V processor core**, designed for education and learning purposes.

### 🔹 Background:

* **Developed by:** *Redwood EDA* and *VLSI System Design (VSD)*.
* **Objective:** To teach students — even beginners and school students — how a real CPU works internally.
* **Built using:** *TL-Verilog (Transaction-Level Verilog)*, which simplifies CPU design by abstracting away repetitive low-level Verilog details.

### 🔹 What it is:

RVMYTH stands for:

> **RISC-V + MYTH (Microprocessor for You in Thirty Hours)**

It’s a **32-bit single-stage RISC-V processor**, meaning:

* It executes one instruction at a time (no pipeline).
* It implements a small subset of the **RISC-V instruction set (RV32I)**.
* You can simulate and even run small assembly programs on it.

### 🔹 Why it’s important:

* It’s **open-source**, so anyone can study, modify, and extend it.
* It helps learners understand the CPU’s internal datapath:

  * **Fetch → Decode → Execute → Memory → Write-back**
* It’s used as the CPU inside educational SoC projects like **BabySoC**.
* It can be integrated with peripherals (GPIO, UART, etc.) to form a complete small System-on-Chip.

### 🔹 In short:

> **RVMYTH** is a simplified, student-built RISC-V CPU that helps beginners understand how processors are designed and work at the RTL level.

---

## ⚙️ **2. What is PLL (Phase-Locked Loop)?**

A **Phase-Locked Loop (PLL)** is a **control system** that generates a clock signal whose **phase and frequency are synchronized** (locked) to a reference signal.

### 🔹 Purpose:

In SoCs and digital systems, PLLs are used to:

* **Generate high-frequency clocks** from a low-frequency reference (e.g., 100 MHz → 1 GHz).
* **Reduce clock jitter** and maintain timing stability.
* **Synchronize** internal clocks with external ones.

### 🔹 How it works (conceptually):

1. **Reference Clock (Input):** A stable clock signal from a crystal oscillator.
2. **Voltage-Controlled Oscillator (VCO):** Generates an adjustable clock.
3. **Phase Detector:** Compares the phase of input and output clocks.
4. **Loop Filter:** Adjusts voltage to the VCO so that the phases match.
5. **Locked State:** When output frequency = input frequency × multiplier, and phase difference = 0.

So, a PLL “locks” onto the input signal’s phase and frequency — that’s why it’s called *Phase-Locked Loop*.

### 🔹 In short:

> **PLL** is used for **clock generation, frequency multiplication, and synchronization** in digital and communication systems.

---

## 🎚️ **3. What is DAC (Digital-to-Analog Converter)?**

A **DAC** converts **digital binary values (0s and 1s)** into a **continuous analog voltage or current**.

### 🔹 Why it’s needed:

* Digital circuits (like CPUs or SoCs) produce *discrete digital signals*.
* Real-world signals (like audio, radio, temperature, etc.) are *analog*.
* So, a DAC bridges the gap — it takes digital data and outputs an analog waveform.

### 🔹 Example:

If your SoC or microcontroller wants to output an **audio tone**, the DAC converts a digital sine wave (series of numbers) into a **smooth analog signal** that can drive a speaker.

### 🔹 Applications:

* **Audio systems:** Convert digital music to analog sound.
* **Communication systems:** Generate modulated RF signals.
* **Video systems:** Convert digital video data to analog voltage levels.
* **Instrumentation:** Generate precise analog voltages for testing.

### 🔹 In short:

> **DAC** turns digital data into analog signals for communication, control, or audio applications.

3. Why BabySoC is a Simplified Model for Learning SoC Concepts

BabySoC is a pedagogical or educational SoC model that simplifies the complexity of a full SoC for learning purposes:

Reduced complexity: Focuses on core components (CPU, memory, interconnect) without advanced peripherals.

Understandable dataflow: Learners can trace how instructions and data move between modules.

Hands-on experimentation: Easy to simulate using tools like Icarus Verilog and GTKWave.

Step towards real SoC design: Teaches the concepts of clocking, reset, and module communication before diving into full-scale RTL and physical design.

Essentially, BabySoC is a miniature laboratory for understanding SoC behavior in a controlled, manageable environment.

4. The Role of Functional Modelling before RTL and Physical Design

Functional modelling is the process of simulating and validating the behavior of a system at a high level (functional level) before worrying about hardware synthesis.

Why it’s important:

Validates design logic: Ensures the system works correctly from a functional perspective.

Reduces errors early: Helps catch mistakes before writing RTL or performing synthesis.

Speeds up development: Functional models are quicker to simulate than detailed RTL.

Serves as a reference for RTL: Provides a clear specification that RTL and physical design should follow.

Example workflow:

Build a functional model of the CPU, memory, and interconnect.

Simulate data transfer and instruction execution using a tool like Icarus Verilog.

Verify correctness using GTKWave waveforms.

Once validated, proceed to RTL design (register-transfer level) and finally physical design (synthesizable hardware).

Functional modelling bridges the gap between theory and real hardware, ensuring design correctness early in the design cycle.
